# Enterprise Design System WordPress Integration

## Project Overview

This project creates a bridge between UHS's Enterprise Design System and WordPress, specifically focusing on integrating with the Avada theme and Fusion Builder. The system enables a seamless workflow from design in Figma through to production WordPress components.

## System Components

### Design Tools

- Figma (Primary Design Tool)
- Tokens Studio Plugin (Design Token Management)
- Style Dictionary v4 (Token Transformation)
- Storybook (Component Development & Testing)

### Development Tools

- WordPress
- Avada Theme
- Fusion Builder
- GitHub (Version Control & Token Storage)
- CI/CD Pipeline

### Bridge Components

1. Design Token Pipeline

   - Figma → Tokens Studio → GitHub → WordPress
   - W3C-compliant token transformation
   - Version control and synchronization

2. Component Development Pipeline

   - Figma → Storybook → WordPress
   - Component testing and validation
   - Timber/PHP templating support

3. WordPress Integration
   - Avada Theme compatibility
   - Fusion Builder component registration
   - Non-destructive augmentation

## Key Goals

1. **Design Token Management**

   - Seamless token synchronization from Figma to WordPress
   - Maintainable token structure
   - Version control and change tracking

2. **Component Development**

   - Standardized component creation process
   - Testing environment in Storybook
   - Flexible templating options (PHP/Timber)

3. **WordPress Integration**

   - Clean Avada/Fusion Builder integration
   - WYSIWYG editor compatibility
   - Performance optimization

4. **Version Control**
   - GitHub-based workflow
   - Change visualization
   - Automated synchronization where possible

## Success Criteria

1. Designers can:

   - Manage design tokens in Figma
   - Preview components in context
   - Export components for development

2. Developers can:

   - Access latest design tokens
   - Develop components in isolation
   - Test components before WordPress integration

3. Content Editors can:
   - Use components in Fusion Builder
   - Preview changes accurately
   - Maintain design system consistency

## Constraints

1. Technical

   - Must work within Avada/Fusion Builder framework
   - Support existing WordPress infrastructure
   - Maintain performance standards

2. Process

   - Support both automated and manual workflows
   - Provide fallback mechanisms
   - Enable gradual adoption

3. Maintenance
   - Documentation requirements
   - Version control requirements
   - Testing requirements
